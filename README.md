# A simple Unity camera controller containing dragging (right mouse button), zooming (scroll wheel) and keyboard inputs (wasd, arrows) and zoom (q,e).
## Based on Tilemap
### (Made so you can't drag over UI, if you dont want that comment out Line 45 "&& !UnityEngine.EventSystems.EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject()")
